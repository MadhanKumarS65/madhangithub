    <h1>ALGORITHM</h1>
    <p>An algorithm is a well-defined, step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a specific problem or performing a computation. Algorithms are fundamental to computer science because they provide the instructions that a computer follows to execute tasks and solve problem</p>

    <h2>EFFICIENCY AND OPTIMIZATION</h2>
        <li>Performance: </li><p>Algorithms help determine the most efficient way to perform tasks. For instance, in sorting or searching large datasets, the choice of algorithm can significantly impact the time and resources required.
        <li>Resource Management:</li> <p>Efficient algorithms reduce computational resource usage (like memory and processing power), which is crucial for designing scalable systems and applications.</P>

    <h3>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
    <li>Code Implementation:</li>
    <p> Algorithms serve as the blueprint for writing code. They define the logic that developers implement in programming languages.
   <li> Debugging and Testing:</li>
   <p> Algorithms make it easier to identify bugs and test software by providing a clear sequence of operations.
